# Deploy Azure DevOps Server

## Deploys Azure DevOps Server 2019 using Azure SQL Databases

## Quick Start

<a href="https://portal.azure.us/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fusri%2Fdeploy_DevOps_Server_AzureSQL%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank"><img src="http://azuredeploy.net/AzureGov.png"/></a>

## Details

This template assumes that you are a US regulated entity with typical requirements for role seperation and security controls.  This template assumes you will be deploying into a pre-existing environment.  For deployment to be successful, please ensure the following pre-requisites:

* A virtual network exists and has VNET Service Endpoints enabled for Azure SQL & Azure Storage
* A [user-assigned Azure Managed Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-portal) has been created to serve as the identity of the Azure virtual machine that is deployed as part of this template.
* An Azure Key Vault exists and a corresponding secret also exists which contains the password of the Azure AD SQL Admin account defined in the template.  Please ensure that the user-assigned managed identity you have created has permission to 'Get' secrets from the Key Vault.
* A custom image which contains the installation of Azure DevOps Server 2020 (installed only, do not configure until after the deployment), SQL CMD, SQL Management Studio, and Java SDK 8.  Please see addtional notes below for links to each. 
  * Set system environment variable "JAVA_HOME" to the java install path, if you use the link below by default the path would be, "C:\Program Files\Zulu\zulu-8". 
  * Install the "Web Server (IIS)" on the server using role and feature defaults, open IIS manager and delete the default web site,then follow link below to finish creating VM image.
  * See [create a managed image of a generalized VM in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/capture-image-resource) to aid in the creation of an image. 
* An Active Directory domain is avalaible for computer join operations and is accessible from within the specified virtual network.
  * As part of the template deployment, you must provide Active Directory domain information to enable the Azure DevOps Server to join your Active Directory domain.
* To automatically deploy all the required infrastructure, utilize our <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/aad-hybrid-lab" target="_blank">AAD Hybrid Deployment template</a>.  NOTE:  You do not need to configure Azure AD Connect piece of the hybrid deployment template.
  * After deploying the hybrid infrastructure, please enable VNET Service Endpoings on the resulting VNET - Azure SQL & Azure Storage

This template deploys the following infrastructure:

* Azure SQL Server
  * Azure SQL Database - DevOps Configuration
  * Azure SQL Database - DevOps Default Collection
* Azure VM - Azure DevOps Server 2019
  * Utilizes Azure Managed Identities to connect to Azure SQL
  * Utlizes Azure Key Vault for password information

## Notes

* The NSG is defined for reference, but is isn't production-ready as holes are also opened for RDP, and public IPs are allocated
* One VM size is specified for all VMs

* <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqlcmd-utility?view=sql-server-ver15" target="_blank">SQLCMD</a> - Used to update Azure SQL Server & Databases with permissions for the Azure DevOps Server Managed Identity.  Part of base image.
* <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15" target="_blank">SQL Management Studio</a> - Installed to allow easy management of Azure SQL, plus installs ODBC drivers needed to allow SQL CMD to function correctly.  Part of base image.
* <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads" target="_blank">Azure DevOps Server 2020</a> - Allows developers to bring all the ideals of DevOps to life via the implmentation of CI/CD pipelines, build agents, version control, and so much more.  Part of base image.
* <a href="https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?version=java-8-lts&os=windows&architecture=x86-64-bit&package=jdk" target="_blank">Java 8 JDK</a> - If not already installed, Azure DevOps Server will attempt to download and install when implmenting search services as part of normal system configuration. Part of base image.
* <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/capture-image-resource" target="_blank">Create Custom VM Images</a> - In this template, the image utilized had the four items above pre-installed.  It was then deployed and configured utilzing a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/tutorial-automate-vm-deployment" target="_blank">custom script extension</a>.

## ToDo

## NOTICE/WARNING

* This template is explicitly designed for a lab/classroom environment and is intended to offer a way to move forward by allowing you to import the code and make it your own, fully compliant with the organizations security controls which you represent.
